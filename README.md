# LTBoost
Boosted Hybrids of ensemble gradient algorithm for the long-term time series forecasting (LTSF)

## Datasets

The LTBoost framework is evaluated using nine well-established open-source long-term time series forecasting benchmarks. These datasets are tailored to specific use cases, including traffic, weather, disease spread, and industrial problems, characterized by their multivariate nature. This setup is emblematic of complex forecasting challenges commonly encountered in practice, making these datasets exceptionally well-suited for evaluating models that are lightweight, efficient, and quick in forecasting multivariate long-term time series.
